Model the following movie system as a Graph database. 20
Consider a information about of movie and actors. One movie can have
more than one actor [
1. Identify the labels and relationships, along with their prop!

draw a high-level Graph model.

(:Actor {name: "Leonardo DiCaprio", age: 47})-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie {title: "Inception", business: 800000000, awards: 4})

(:Actor {name: "Christian Bale", age: 48})-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie {title: "The Dark Knight", business: 1000000000, awards: 2})

(:Actor {name: "John Travolta", age: 68})-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie {title: "Pulp Fiction", business: 213000000, awards: 1})

(:Actor {name: "Jamie Foxx", age: 54})-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie {title: "Django Unchained", business: 425000000, awards: 3})


2. Create nodes and relationships, along with their properties, and

visualize your actual Graph model.

// Creating Movies

CREATE (:Movie {title: "Inception", business: 800000000, awards: 4})

CREATE (:Movie {title: "The Dark Knight", business: 1000000000, awards: 2})

CREATE (:Movie {title: "Pulp Fiction", business: 213000000, awards: 1})

CREATE (:Movie {title: "Django Unchained", business: 425000000, awards: 3})


// Creating Actors

CREATE (:Actor {name: "Leonardo DiCaprio", age: 47})

CREATE (:Actor {name: "Christian Bale", age: 48})

CREATE (:Actor {name: "John Travolta", age: 68})

CREATE (:Actor {name: "Jamie Foxx", age: 54})


// Creating Relationships

MATCH (m:Movie {title: "Inception"}), (a:Actor {name: "Leonardo DiCaprio"})

CREATE (a)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)


MATCH (m:Movie {title: "The Dark Knight"}), (a:Actor {name: "Christian Bale"})

CREATE (a)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)


MATCH (m:Movie {title: "Pulp Fiction"}), (a:Actor {name: "John Travolta"})

CREATE (a)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)


MATCH (m:Movie {title: "Django Unchained"}), (a:Actor {name: "Jamie Foxx"})

CREATE (a)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)





3. Answer the Queries:

a. Find movie which made highest business.

MATCH (m:Movie)

WITH m ORDER BY m.business DESC LIMIT 1

RETURN m.title AS movieTitle, m.business AS business;


b. Display details of movie along with actors.

MATCH (m:Movie)-[:ACTED_IN]->(a:Actor)

RETURN m.title AS movieTitle, m.business AS business, COLLECT(a.name) AS actors;


List all thenovie of “Shahrukh Khan”.

MATCH (a:Actor {name: "Shahrukh Khan"})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)

RETURN m.title AS movieTitle, m.business AS business;


d. Display all movie having more than 2 awards received

MATCH (m:Movie)

WHERE m.awards > 2

RETURN m.title AS movieTitle, m.business AS business, m.awards AS awards;
