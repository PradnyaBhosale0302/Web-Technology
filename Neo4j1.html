Model the following food service industry information as 20 graph
model, and answer the following queries using Cypher.
Consider food service industries like ZOMATO, Swiggy around us.

ease sell. A
person order food through this industry and get offers. A person give
rate(1-5 stars) to company its facility/facilities. and can recomend this
:to his/her friends.
4. Identify the labels and relationships, along with their properties, and


draw a high-level Graph model.

(:Person {name: "John", contact_number: "123-456-7890"})-[:MAKES_ORDER]->(:Order {order_id: "123", order_date: "2023-01-01"})

(:FoodService {name: "ZOMATO", delivery_time: "30 minutes"})-[:OFFERS]->(:Offer {discount_percentage: 10, valid_until: "2023-02-28"})

(:Person {name: "Alice"})-[:RATES {stars: 4, review_comment: "Great service!"}]->(:FoodService {name: "Swiggy"})

(:Person {name: "Bob"})-[:RECOMMENDS]->(:Person {name: "Jane"})

5. Create nodes and relationships, along with their properties, and

visualize your actual Graph model.

CREATE (:Person {name: "John", contact_number: "123-456-7890"})

CREATE (:Person {name: "Alice", contact_number: "987-654-3210"})
